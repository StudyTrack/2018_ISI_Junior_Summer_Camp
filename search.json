With General Eng- lish lessons taking place in the classroom, English in Action Projects are a wonderful opportunity to engage with local, native speakers through street surveys, interviews, educational role plays, and short trips to the vast array of local markets. Our highly qualified and experienced teachers have been handpicked for their dynamic and ener- getic teaching approach, guaranteeing an engaging and rewarding student experience. Students will cover 2 - 3 topics per week. Some of these topics are listed below: The Social Programme encourages students to utilise their Morning Lessons, through a series of activities & excursions that reflect their classroom activities of reading, speaking, vocabulary and listening exercises. Lesson themes English in Action Projects (English outside the classroom) Students are encouraged to present their findings from each project to the class in the form of a lively presentation, debate, etc., and are encouraged to make use of the whiteboards and com- puters to illustrate their findings. The class is given an opportunity to ask questions about the presentation, and a vote is taken at the end of the lesson to decide which projects were the most engaging, informative, and educa- tional. Below are some descriptive examples of the engaging English in Action Projects the stu- dents will participate in: In small groups, in class, students pick a location to visit in Ireland and pre- pare questions about this imagined trip. Keeping this progress in mind, stu- dents visit a nearby Tourist Office, interviewing local guides and staff, and collecting information leaflets, recording this information for later use. They bring the information gathered during the class trip back to class to complete the tasks set by the teacher. In class, students learn about different Irish folklore stories, including “The Children of Lir”, and are encouraged to use their imagination in developing characters and dialogues for a story of their choosing. They visit the Garden of Remembrance, and act out scenes from their story, or reimagine the mythical tale beneath the statue of the Children of Lir. Tourist Office Crime & Punishment Music, Movies & Art Pop Culture & Social Media Irish Culture History & Folklore Adventure & Travel Shopping Money & Advertising Health, Medicine & Science Garden of Remembrance ","In pairs, students develop a list of interview questions about a topic of per- sonal interest to them (sport, music, current affairs, etc). Students are then brought to O’Connell/Henry Street, the heart of Dublin City, and in their pairs engage with the public, under the supervision of their teacher. Students prepare a list of survey questions in the classroom, about a specific topic of personal interest to them (e.g. sport, music, current affairs). They then visit other classes in their pairs to conduct a radio interview with fellow international students, teachers, and members of staff. Students prepare vocabulary and questions related to food and shopping. They rehearse role plays with each other where they are monitored for errors and coherence, preparing them for conversational English with local Irish people. They then go out in small, supervised groups to local markets near O’Connell Street/Henry Street, an area made famous by Molly Malone. Students begin with a classroom lesson focusing on the Dublin’s proud cul- ture of Irish and International art. A visit to the famed Hugh Lane Gallery is their next stop, where an interactive questionnaire is to be completed by en- gaging with Gallery Staff, Visitors, and using the exhibitions on display. Hugh Lane Gallery Street Surveys Interviews Local Market Visit Learning Aims Developing student autonomy, instilling confidence, and creating intrigue is at the core of English in Action Projects. While the nuances of improving speaking and listening skills with a focus on fluency and coherence, developing note - taking skills, promoting and en- couraging functional language in realistic situations are each fine - tuned in the General English Lessons, within the classroom. We develop these skills through roleplays, debates, discussions, presentations, interactive mingling activities, songs & poetry, vocabu- lary games such as “back to the board” and “grass skirts”, podcasts and TED talk activities, questionnaires, “show and tell” activities, inter- active computer - based activities. Our specially selected teachers are meticulous in monitoring and checking for fluency and coherence. Students improve these skills via a refreshing use of Realia, with an emphasis on newspapers, magazines, local & international maps, in- ternet blogs & articles, comics, posters, interactive online exercises, story and script writing, social media simulations, etc. Students are encouraged to consolidate and reinforce their vocabulary and commu- nicative skills through focused tasks set by their experienced teachers.
